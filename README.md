## Improvements

Several features have not yet been added:
1. Start menu will be added.
2. A shooting function will be added to the bird.
3. Valves will be added to the pipes. The top and bottom pipes are initially stuck together and will only separate when the valves are triggered. Therefore, the bird needs to shoot the gate to trigger it before passing through the pipe.
4. Clouds will be added to the background at random positions.
